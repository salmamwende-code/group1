    "In today's digital marketplace, social media has become the primary channel where customers express their opinions about products and brands. For companies like Apple and Google, understanding public sentiment on Twitter can provide invaluable insights into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Product reception**: How are new product launches being received?\n",
    "- **Brand health**: What's the overall sentiment toward our brand vs competitors?\n",
    "- **Crisis detection**: Can we identify emerging negative sentiment before it becomes a PR crisis?\n",
    "- **Customer service prioritization**: Which complaints need immediate attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**: Manually analyzing thousands of tweets daily is impossible. Customer service teams are overwhelmed, and by the time negative sentiment is identified through traditional methods, brand damage may already be done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Solution**: Build an automated sentiment classification system that can process Twitter data in real-time, categorizing tweets as positive, negative, neutral, or uncertain. This system will help stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Monitor brand health continuously\n",
    "2. Identify trending issues early\n",
    "3. Route negative sentiment to customer service teams\n",
    "4. Measure campaign effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Success Metrics**: We aim to build a model that can accurately classify tweet sentiment with high precision and recall, particularly for negative sentiment (where misclassification is most costly from a business perspective)."
